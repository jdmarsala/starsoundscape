The Dying Star - a soundscape by John Marsala. Best experienced with headphones.
This is a short, ~1 minute soundscape that is meant to represent the stages of a supernova - the death of a star. The soundscape moves through the initial collapse of the star (~22s mark) to the shockwaves gradually heating the star (~34-48s mark) to the final explosion of the star, using a variety of organic and synthesized audio samples ranging everywhere from pitch-shifted bass drums to distorted whale songs.
